# Hand-Gesture-recognition
**Hand Gesture recognition Using Pytorch**
**Introduction:** 
The field of hand gesture detection in computer vision is captivating as it centers on 
interpreting hand movements for seamless human-computer interaction. Deep Convolutional 
Neural Networks (DCNNs) have emerged as potent tools in this domain, showcasing efficacy in 
various computer vision tasks, including hand gesture recognition. DCNNs, a specialized 
neural network class, excel in processing visual data like images and videos. Their automatic 
feature extraction from raw pixel data empowers them to adeptly address complex 
undertakings such as hand gesture recognition. Through the deep network's hierarchical 
structure, DCNNs capture both low-level visual elements like edges and textures, and highlevel semantic cues, 
facilitating precise hand gesture recognition and classification.


**Objective**: 
The primary objective of this project is to create an advanced hand gesture recognition system 
using customized ResNet architectures. By designing ResNet models tailored to interpret near 
infrared images captured by the Leap Motion sensor, the project aims to achieve seamless and 
intuitive human-computer interaction. The project will encompass data collection, 
preprocessing, and augmentation to enhance the quality of the training dataset. Through 
iterative training and fine-tuning, the custom ResNet architectures will be optimized to 
accurately recognize and classify intricate hand gestures. Rigorous evaluation and analysis will 
gauge the models' performance, and their potential for enhancing human-computer interaction 
paradigms will be demonstrated through real-world applications.


**Data**: 
This project uses a rich and meticulously curated dataset obtained from the "LeapGestRecog" 
repository on Kaggle. The dataset encompasses near infrared images capturing various hand 
gestures performed by distinct subjects. With an organizational architecture that mirrors realworld complexities, 
the dataset encompasses ten subjects, each engaging in ten different 
gestures. This hierarchical arrangement enables the exploration of intricate variations in hand 
gestures, accounting for diverse lighting conditions, hand sizes, and orientations. Each 
subdirectory further contains 200 near infrared images, each snapshot capturing the subtle 
nuances of hand movements.


**Approach:**
The project approach entails a systematic and comprehensive methodology to develop an 
effective hand gesture recognition system using custom ResNet architectures. The approach 
can be summarized as follows:

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
• Acquire the "LeapGestRecog" dataset from Kaggle, containing near infrared images 
categorized by subjects and gestures.
• Conduct thorough data preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and noise 
reduction, to ensure data quality and compatibility with ResNet architectures.
• Apply data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, and brightness 
adjustments to augment the dataset and enhance model generalization.

**Custom ResNet Architectures:**
• Design and adapt custom ResNet architectures that are tailored to the unique 
characteristics of near infrared imagery captured by the Leap Motion sensor.
• Incorporate architectural modifications to ensure effective feature extraction, including 
optimizing filter sizes, skip connections, and residual blocks.
• Integrate batch normalization and dropout layers strategically to enhance convergence 
and mitigate overfitting.

**Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning:**
• Utilize transfer learning by initializing the custom ResNet architectures with pre-trained 
weights from existing models trained on large-scale datasets.
• Fine-tune the models on the preprocessed and augmented dataset to specialize them 
for accurate hand gesture recognition.
• Employ adaptive learning rates, optimization algorithms, and regularization techniques 
to enhance model convergence and performance.

**Model Evaluation and Analysis:**
• Rigorously evaluate the custom ResNet models using established metrics such as 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on validation and testing sets.
• Conduct ablation studies to systematically analyze the impact of architectural choices, 
hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques on model performance.
• Employ cross-validation to ensure robustness and verify the models' generalization 
capabilities across diverse hand gestures and subjects.
